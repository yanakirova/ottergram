How I created my web site?

First, I start with the basic construction of the project, which means I created root directories and directories inside of it.
Then, for every of html files created a link to css file.

index.html
for index.html file I created navigation menu with links to the other html already existed web pages.The way that 
I created it is not my idea, I use the guidance of http://www.w3schools.com and just changed some of the things. 


CV.hmtl
For that part I first choose from Google's shrift? and made a link to it in my file. Made the basic contruct of that page
i.e put all main part in <h3> tag because I then to be the same.
